Computer Vision based carbohydrate estimator which detects carbs from an image of food.


% This file performs the following operations
% 1. Converts image to binary with a threshold and Canny edge detection is
%    performed to find the boundary of the plate.
% 2. Finds the best fitting elliptical shape of the plate boundary:
%    Reference https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33970-ellipse-detection-using-1d-hough-transform
% 3. Calculates the area of the plate using minor and major axis.
% 4. A mask is created for the plate by coverting to HSV and applied on the
%    original image
% 5. Food is segmented from the plate and Median Shift Clustering is
%    performed on the segmented food. 
%    Reference: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52698-k-means--mean-shift-and-normalized-cut-segmentation
% 6. Features of the food items from the clusters are extracted and individual area is
%    calulated.
% 7. The CHO content of the detcted items are displayed.
